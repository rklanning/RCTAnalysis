# Randomized Trial Analysis of Heparin Dosage in Acute Ischemic Stroke Outcomes
## Last Updated March 2025

This project was a part of my Applied Statistics in Clinical Trials I course, completed in May 2025. The following is the prompt that explains the source of the analysis: 

"The International Stroke Trial (IST), conducted between 1991 and 1996 was a large, randomized controlled trial of individuals with suspected acute ischaemic stroke. The aim of the trial was to establish whether early administration of aspirin, heparin, both or neither influenced the clinical course of acute ischaemic stroke. For these analyses, we will use a subset of the data for participants randomized to Low Dose Heparin, High Dose Heparin or Heparin placebo in a 1:1:2 allocation.  All participants in these groups also received aspirin."
